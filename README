Known parse errors:
- If a team's name changes midgame, and the team's name is mentioned (e.g. in a mound visit) before they start batting, their name won't be recognised.
- If a player is relegated midgame, and the new player fields before they bat/pitch, their name won't be recognised.

This is primarily intended as a library crate, but the following barebones binaries are provided for use.

# Download
To download and cache all completed games, run:
```
cargo run --release --features=reqwest,tokio --bin downloader "path to the download cache"
```

# Parse
To parse all games in a folder of cached games:
```
cargo run --release --bin parser "path to the download cache" "path to where events should be saved"
```
(if you want it to crash on an unknown parse fail, remove the "--release" flag.)
