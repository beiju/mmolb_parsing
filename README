If using as a binary to parse games with id X, Y and Z run:
```
cargo run --features=main X Y Z
```

If you're getting an error try running with debuging to figure out what is new in your game that wasn't in my 9-game test set. (warning, very verbose)
```
cargo run --features=main,parsing_debug X Y Z
```
