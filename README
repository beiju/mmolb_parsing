Known parse errors:
- If a team's name changes between the start of game and the PitchingMatchup (the second event of a game), the parser is unable to parse that event. Team name changes at any other time should be fine.

This is primarily intended as a library crate, but the following barebones binaries are provided for use.

# Download
To download and cache all completed games, run:
```
cargo run --release --features=reqwest,tokio --bin downloader "path to the download cache"
```

# Parse
To parse all games in a folder of cached games:
```
cargo run --release --bin parser "path to the download cache" "path to where events should be saved"
```
if you want it to crash on an unknown parse failure, add --features="panic_on_parse_error"
if you want to randomise the order it parses in, add --features="rand"
