Known parse errors:
- If a team's name changes between the start of game and the PitchingMatchup (the second event of a game), the parser is unable to parse that event. Team name changes at any other time should be fine.

This is primarily intended as a library crate, but the a barebones binary are provided for use.

# Parse
```
cargo run --release --bin parser OUTPUT_PATH
```

Errors are sent to stderr also.
