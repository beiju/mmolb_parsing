To download and cache all completed games, run:
```
cargo run --release --features=reqwest,tokio --bin downloader "path to the download cache"
```

To parse all games in a folder of cached games:
```
cargo run --release --bin parser "path to the download cache" "path to where events should be saved"
```
(if you want it to crash on an unknown parse fail, remove the "--release" flag.)
