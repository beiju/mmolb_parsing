Known parse errors:
- If a team's name changes between the start of game and the PitchingMatchup (the second event of a game), the parser is unable to parse that event. Team name changes at any other time should be fine.

This is primarily intended as a library crate, but the a barebones binary are provided for use.

# Library
## Game event parsing
See parser binary.
`mmolb_parsing::Game` - can be deserialized from the mmolb api response.
- has an event_log field, a vec of events.
`mmolb_parsing::process_event`
- produce a `mmolb_parsing::ParsedEventMessage` from an event and a game.

## Feed parsing
See feed_parser binary.
`mmolb_parsing::team::Team` - can be deserialized from the mmolb api response
- has a feed field, `Vec<mmolb_parsing::feed_event::FeedEvent>`
`mmolb_parsing::feed_event::FeedEvent`
- has an event_type field, which can be cast to an `Option<mmolb_parsing::enums::FeedEventType>` with into_inner.
- has a text field, `mmolb_parsing::feed_event::FeedEventText` with a parse() method that takes an event_type.

Alternatively `mmolb_parsing::nom_parsing::parse_feed_event` is provided

# Parse

cargo run --release --bin parser OUTPUT_PATH

Errors are sent to stderr also.
